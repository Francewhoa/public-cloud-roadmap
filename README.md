# (Beta) OVHcloud "Containers and Orchestration" Public Roadmap

This repository is part of an upcoming serie, covering all services of OVHCloud Public Cloud Ecosystem. (Links to compute, storage, network and data sections to be added here.)

## How to use
- You can consult [the project board](https://github.com/mhurtrel/containers-orchestration-roadmap/projects/1 "the project board") to **find out the current features planned** in the backlog
- You can **"watch" a given feature** to get email notifications when it is modified or moves in the workflow
- You can **comment or vote** for listed features  to influence or specifications and prioritization
- You can** suggest a new issue** to the backlog 

## Workflow
- New issues will be considered typically within a week and may enter **Backlog** if they correspond to our product strategy.
- We regularly commit to new items on the backlog. "**Comitted/Being developped**" column means that the feature has been sized and is planned for the **next 3-12 months**
- When these elements approach production, they are moved to "**Coming soon**". At that stage, specification are final, and the feature will hit GA usually in less than** 2 months**
- We will keep new features for a couple of months after their release in the "**Changelog**" column for follow-up.


## Proposing a new feature
- Please consult [Existing issues](https://github.com/mhurtrel/containers-orchestration-roadmap/issues "Existing issues") and [product documentation](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/kubernetes/ "product documentation") to avoid duplicates
- Please describe the feature in the shortest possible way, ideally as a agile user story
- We are interested in your use case associated and the current workaround you have found if they exist. Please comment your own issue with those details if possible. 

## Notes/Disclaimer

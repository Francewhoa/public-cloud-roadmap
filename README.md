# (Beta) OVHcloud "Containers and Orchestration" Public Roadmap

This repository will progressively cover all services of OVHCloud Public Cloud Ecosystem. (Compute, storage, network sections to be added soon.)

## How to use
- You can consult the board of your choice to **find out the current features planned** in the backlog :
[Orchestration and Containers board ](https://github.com/mhurtrel/containers-orchestration-roadmap/projects/1 "Orchestration and Containers board")
[Databases, Data Analytics and AI board ](https://github.com/mhurtrel/containers-orchestration-roadmap/projects/2 "Databases, Data Analytics and AI board")
- You can **watch a given feature** to get email notifications when it is modified or moves in the workflow
- You can **comment or vote** for listed features to influence or specifications and prioritization
- You can **suggest a new issue** to the backlog 

## Workflow
- New issues will be considered typically within a week and may enter one of the board's **Backlog** if they correspond to our product strategy.
- We regularly commit to new items on the backlog. "**Comitted/Being developped**" column means that the feature has been sized and is planned for the **next 3-12 months**
- When these elements approach production, they are moved to "**Coming soon**". At that stage, specification are final, and the feature will hit GA usually in less than **2 months**
- We will keep new features for a couple of months after their release in the "**Changelog**" column for follow-up.

## Proposing a new featur
- Consider only new features (aka fucntionnal enhancements, new localizations, UX improvments). Specific bugs or support should be open through  [the OVHcloud help center](https://help.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/ "the OVHcloud help center")
- If you believe you've found a security issue in our service, please enter our [bug bounty programm ](https://yeswehack.com/programs/ovh#rules "bug bounty programm ")
- Please consult [Existing issues](https://github.com/mhurtrel/containers-orchestration-roadmap/issues "Existing issues") and [product documentation](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/kubernetes/ "product documentation") to avoid duplicates
- Please describe the feature in the shortest possible way, ideally as a agile user story
- We are interested in your use case associated and the current workaround you have found if they exist. Please comment your own issue with those details if possible. 

## Notes/Disclaimer
- This public roadmap is purely indicative, and we may surprise you with additionnal strategic feature that we choose to keep confidential for some reasons.
- We may delete any innapropriate content at any time.
